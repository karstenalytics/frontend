# Staker Conviction

Understanding protocol loyalty through reward behavior analysis.

Stakers can choose to **compound** their rewards (reinvesting back into TUNA) or **claim** them (taking profits). This analysis examines **1,749 stakers who actively managed their rewards** (claimed or compounded) between July 27 - October 25, 2025.

:::info Data Scope
Out of **8,003 total unique stakers** (ever staked since July 25 launch), **4,055 currently hold active stakes** (as of October 27, 2025). This analysis focuses on the 1,749 who actively managed rewards, representing **21.8% of all stakers** or **43.1% of current active stakers**.
:::

:::warning Stake Size Visualization Scope
The stake distribution and scatter plot visualizations are based on a subset of users with both position data and reward activity (approximately 599 wallets). This represents users who have both staking positions AND have claimed/compounded rewards. More comprehensive per-user position tracking is in development to include all 4,055 current active stakers.
:::

**Key Insight**: The data reveals a surprising "Inverse Whale Effect" - medium-tier stakers demonstrate the highest conviction, not the largest holders.

                <h3>Position Size Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                  Understanding how TUNA holdings are distributed across the staker base reveals the
                  protocol's user composition and potential concentration risks.

            <h3>What This Tells Us</h3>
            <p>
              Nearly <strong>60% of active reward managers never compound their rewards</strong>, treating
              staking primarily as yield farming rather than long-term investment. However, a dedicated core
              of <strong>23.6% (412 users)</strong> exclusively compound, demonstrating strong protocol
              conviction. Note: The remaining ~2,300 current stakers either haven't claimed rewards yet or
              are passively holding their positions.

                <p>
                  Examining the relationship between stake size and compound behavior at the
                  individual wallet level reveals the "Inverse Whale Effect" - larger holders show
                  weaker conviction than medium-tier stakers.

            <h3>Understanding the Paradox</h3>
            <p>Why do smaller stakers show more loyalty than whales?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Medium stakers (0.1-1 SOL)</strong>: Core believers, likely community members
                invested in long-term success
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Whales (&gt;10 SOL)</strong>: More profit-oriented, likely professional yield
                farmers
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Small stakers (&lt;0.1 SOL)</strong>: Experimenting, learning the protocol
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This pattern suggests your <strong>most loyal community is in the middle tier</strong> -
              these are the users most aligned with protocol success. Among the 4,055 current active
              stakers, the 1,749 who actively manage rewards represent the most engaged segment of the
              protocol.

            <h3>Trend Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              The weekly compound rate shows <strong>no clear upward trend</strong>, ranging from 0% to
              20.8% with an overall average of 5.3%. This suggests current behavior is stable rather than
              improving, indicating that compound rates reflect established user preferences rather than
              market conditions.

              <h4>How Metrics Are Calculated</h4>

              <p>
                <strong>Loyalty Score</strong>: Percentage of users who have only compounded rewards
                (never claimed). These "true believers" demonstrate the highest protocol conviction.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Reinvestment Rate</strong>: Percentage of total rewards that were compounded
                rather than claimed, calculated as:
              </p>
              <pre style={{ background: 'var(--ifm-color-emphasis-100)', padding: '12px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
                Reinvestment Rate = (Total Compounded SOL / Total Rewards SOL) Ã— 100
              </pre>

              <p>
                <strong>User Behavior Segments</strong>:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Compound-only</strong>: Users who have never executed a ClaimReward transaction
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Claim-only</strong>: Users who have never executed a CompoundReward transaction
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mixed</strong>: Users who have executed both ClaimReward and CompoundReward
                  transactions
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Reward Size Tiers</strong>: Users are segmented based on their total rewards
                earned (compounded + claimed) during the analysis period:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Small: &lt;0.1 SOL</li>
                <li>Medium: 0.1-1 SOL</li>
                <li>Large: 1-10 SOL</li>
                <li>Whales: &gt;10 SOL</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Data Source</h4>

              <p>
                Analysis is based on on-chain transaction data from the DefiTuna staking program,
                covering the period from <strong>{date_range.start}</strong> to{' '}
                <strong>{date_range.end}</strong>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reward amounts are extracted from transaction logs (ClaimReward and CompoundReward
                instructions) and tracked per unique wallet address (fee payer). The data is updated as
                part of the daily analytics pipeline.
              </p>

              <h4>Staker Population Context</h4>

              <p>
                <strong>Total Stakers Ever</strong>: 8,003 unique wallets have staked since the July 25,
                2025 public sale (includes 6,776 auto-staked participants + 2,008 manual stakers, with 781
                overlap).
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Current Active Stakers</strong>: 4,055 wallets currently hold non-zero staking
                balances (as of October 27, 2025). This represents 50.6% retention from the initial cohort.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Reward Active Stakers</strong>: 1,749 wallets (21.8% of total, 43.1% of current
                active) have claimed or compounded rewards during the analysis period. These represent the
                most engaged users who actively manage their positions.
