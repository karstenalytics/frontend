# About this section

This section is the heart of this project and provides tailored analytics for Solana-based DeFi protocols, with a focus on **high data quality and easy to understand on-chain data**. I try to keep this as fact-based as possible, and use the Article section if I want to share opinions about this data or longer explanations.

Visualization of the data is done via plotly charts. You can zoom in and out as you want. Some of the charts are enriched with tables that allow a deep dive into transactions or wallets. This should help to understand which type of transactions are behind the data and also do some sanity checks.

If you want to understand the details about how the information you are seeing on this page is created, please check out the next page (Data Pipeline). My ambition is to make it as clear as possible what the numbers mean, in case you want to get into the details. 

## Protocol Coverage

### DefiTuna Treasury Analytics

The DefiTuna protocol treasury is my primary focus, with comprehensive coverage including:

- **Revenue Attribution**: Multi-dimensional breakdowns by token, transaction type, and liquidity pool
- **Staking APR**: Historical yield calculations based on treasury inflows and token metrics
- **Daily Trends**: Time-series analysis of revenue patterns and growth
- **Usage Statistics**: Cohort views of stakers plus daily and weekly active wallets developments
- **TUNA Treasury Allocation**: Daily split of treasury-held TUNA between staked and liquid balances
- **Top Transactions**: Detailed views of largest revenue events

Navigate to the **DefiTuna** section in the sidebar to explore interactive dashboards and detailed analytics.

### Will you just cover DefiTuna?

After going live I want to clean up first and react on user feedback (if there is any). Then I intend to cover additional DeFi protocols that fit into my scope and additional aspects of DefiTuna like Positions.
