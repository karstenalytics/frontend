# Background & Motivation

I've been following the Blockchain/Crypto industry long before the Solana DeFi ecosystem came to be. My original focus was on other ecosystems, like Ethereum or the XRPL. But regardless of which blockchain or ecosystem, **for me it was always clear that we are seeing the rewiring of how financial services, infrastructure, and even trust works**. An opinion I still hold.

My professional background is in Management Consulting, and I've been working for a Big 4 firm for many years. I've supported major players across different industries in global technology-enabled transformations. But in recent months this was not something that I did with enthusiasm.

On the other hand: While I have no formal education or degree in Software Engineering, **developing products has always been something I've enjoyed** for various reasons:

- It's challenging and you learn a lot on the job
- You create something that others can use
- Not many people could do it, so I had an edge and got business others didn't get

During my education years, I built software (web-based and mobile apps for phones & tablets), and I still look back fondly at that time for the reasons mentioned above.

Now I've decided to take a longer sabbatical to re-evaluate my next steps. This project is an outcome of that decision. I enjoy building it, and I want to see where it leads. This also means I'm open to collaboration—**let me know if you want to discuss the content I provide, have ideas for covering certain topics, or think there are topics I could help you with based on what you see on this site.**
