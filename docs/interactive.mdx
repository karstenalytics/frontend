# Interactive Analytics

Welcome to the interactive analytics dashboard for the karstenalytics treasury. This dashboard provides real-time insights into on-chain treasury analytics for Solana, with data sourced directly from the exported analytics bundle.

The dashboard reads from the following data sources:
- **Daily aggregations**: Stacked and cumulative views across all historical days
- **Top transactions**: Transaction-level details organized by token, type, and pool
- **Distribution analysis**: Pool Ã— Type breakdown with Marimekko visualization
- **Summary statistics**: Overall metrics and top performers by value

The data bundle is regenerated by the private analytics pipeline and can be updated by copying fresh exports to `static/analytics/data/`.

## About the Data

The treasury analytics system achieves **100% revenue attribution accuracy** through transaction-level classification using log-based analysis. The dashboard displays:

- **WSOL Direct Inflows**: Native SOL transfers to the treasury
- **Token Revenue**: Cross-token revenue converted to SOL equivalents
- **Pool Activity**: Revenue broken down by liquidity pool (Orca, Fusion, etc.)
- **Transaction Types**: Revenue classified by operation type (liquidations, fees, transfers, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

This dashboard will continue to evolve with:
- **Interactive charts**: Breakdown, trends, and distribution visualizations using Plotly
- **Advanced filtering**: Date range selection, grouping modes, and threshold controls
- **Additional widgets**: Inline analytics and methodology deep-dives
- **Multiple treasury views**: Support for analyzing additional treasury addresses

The foundation is complete with full data loading, dark/light mode support, and responsive design. Interactive chart components are the next phase of development.
