# DefiTuna Overview

This section captures product notes, release highlights, and methodology explainers for the DefiTuna treasury analytics initiative. Flesh it out with the narratives that accompany each analytics update.

Start by outlining:

- The goals of the treasury analytics program.
- How on-chain data is collected, classified, and cached.
- Links to deeper dives that live in the private repo or runbooks.

Feel free to create additional pages in this folder; add them to `mkdocs.yml` to expose them in the navigation.
