  I'm glad you made it. Make yourself comfortable. This is for sure not the most interesting content on this page, but it seems you're bored or interested enough to continue reading anyhow.

  I want to briefly summarize three key points I want to bring across: My motivation and pain points I want to address, what the scope of this project will be, and how the technical set-up roughly looks like.

    <h3><span class="icon ph ph-rocket-launch"></span>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      First and foremost: I follow Crypto since 2017, and as most of you know, it's a rabbit hole and hard to ignore once you tasted it. I'm strongly convinved that the foundation of our financial systems is being rewired based on what's happening right now. 

      I always considered trying to get a hold in the industry, but life always held me back. Now there's a window of opportunity, as I have a bit of time on my hands for a side project for one year, so I decided to get going and build something. I enjoyed coding before I started my current profession - and here we are.

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <div class="section-grid">
    <p>
    This project provides on-chain data analytics for Solana DeFi protocols. Analytics for me means coming from the overall objective a protocol has. Which ultimately always is the same: Generating value for users and investors. 
    Let's say a protocol shares revenue with its investors via staking. What I want to understand is:
    <ul>
      <li>Where does the revenue come from?</li>
      <li>What are the main revenue drivers?</li>
      <li>How are the main revenue drivers developing so far and most probably going to develop in the future?</li>
      <li>On-chain data only looks backwards and does not provide complete information. Is there other data we can look at to get a more complete picture (e.g. behaviour of Users or "Whales")</li>
    </ul>
    
    I'm not so much interested in the current price of a protocol's token. This project is more about understanding fundamentals, and for this I want to understand how key metrics I can see on-chain develop.
    Also, Technical Analysis is something I also like to follow up on (but not create), as I believe it works in some cases (Support, Resistance etc.)
